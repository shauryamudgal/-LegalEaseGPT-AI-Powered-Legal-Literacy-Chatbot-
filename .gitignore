Generated audio files (from gTTS)
The static/ directory might contain generated audio responses.
We ignore all files in static/ by default, then unignore *.css explicitly.
static/*
!static/*.css

Explicitly include core project files
The following files are explicitly included by unignoring them,
even if a broader ignore rule might catch them.
!app.py
!embed.py
!preprocess.py
!retrieve.py
!inspect_chunks.py
!requirements.txt
!.env.example # It's good practice to include an example .env file
