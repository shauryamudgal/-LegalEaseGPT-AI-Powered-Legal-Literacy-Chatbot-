The primary legislation guiding tenant rights and landlord-tenant relationships in India is the Model Tenancy Act, 2021, which was approved by the Union Cabinet and circulated to all States and Union Territories for adoption or suitable amendment of existing rental laws. The Act aims to regulate renting of premises in an efficient and transparent manner, balancing and protecting the interests of both landlords and tenants, and providing a speedy dispute resolution mechanism.

The Model Tenancy Act applies to both residential and non-residential premises across urban and rural areas. It establishes a Rent Authority to oversee rental agreements and disputes, along with Rent Courts and Rent Tribunals for adjudication and appeals. Under this Act, civil courts do not have jurisdiction over matters covered by it.

Key features and provisions of the Model Tenancy Act include:

Written Agreement: The landlord and tenant must enter into a written rental agreement specifying rent amount, tenancy period, security deposit, and other terms. This brings clarity and legal enforceability to the tenancy.

Security Deposit: For residential premises, the security deposit is capped at two months’ rent, and for non-residential premises, at six months’ rent. This prevents excessive demands by landlords.

Rent Payment and Fair Rent: The Act provides protection against arbitrary rent hikes. Rent must be paid on time as agreed. Tenants can challenge unfair or exorbitant rent demands.

Eviction Conditions: Tenants cannot be evicted without valid reasons such as refusal or failure to pay rent for over two months, unauthorized occupation of the premises or part thereof, or misuse of premises despite written notice. Eviction requires due process through the Rent Authority or Rent Court.

Rights of Tenants: Tenants have the right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises without unlawful interference. They are entitled to basic amenities and privacy. The landlord cannot enter the premises without tenant consent except in emergencies.

Duties of Tenants: Tenants must pay rent timely, maintain the premises in good condition, use the property only for the agreed purpose, give proper notice before vacating, and comply with laws related to the premises.

Dispute Resolution: The Act creates a three-tier quasi-judicial mechanism — Rent Authority for initial complaints, Rent Court for appeals, and Rent Tribunal for further appeals. This system ensures speedy and specialized resolution of tenancy disputes.

No Overlapping Jurisdiction: Civil courts are barred from entertaining disputes covered under the Model Tenancy Act, avoiding parallel litigation and delays.

Prior to the Model Tenancy Act, tenant rights were governed by various state-specific Rent Control Acts, which often favored tenants by restricting rent increases and making eviction difficult for landlords. These laws contributed to a shortage of rental housing supply. The Model Tenancy Act seeks to modernize and balance the interests of both parties to promote rental housing growth.

Common tenancy practices in India include the use of 11-month leave and license agreements, which are preferred by landlords to avoid the stricter rent control laws that apply to leases exceeding 12 months. Leave and license agreements provide landlords more flexibility in eviction and rent revision.

The legal framework protects tenants from unlawful eviction, arbitrary rent hikes, and ensures their right to privacy and peaceful possession. Tenants can approach the Rent Authority or Rent Tribunal for grievances related to rent, eviction, maintenance, or breach of agreement.

In summary, India’s tenant laws are evolving with the Model Tenancy Act, 2021 providing a comprehensive, transparent, and balanced framework for rental housing. It protects tenant rights such as fair rent, security of tenure, privacy, and access to speedy dispute resolution, while also safeguarding landlords’ interests to encourage the growth of rental housing stock.

The Model Tenancy Act, 2021 was introduced to modernize and standardize rental housing laws across India. Its main objectives are to regulate the renting of premises, protect the interests of both tenants and landlords, and establish a speedy dispute resolution system. The Act is a model law, meaning it is not automatically applicable; each state or union territory must adopt or adapt it, since land and rental matters are state subjects under the Constitution. This means implementation may vary, and existing rental agreements before the Act remain outside its scope[1][4][5][6].

The Act applies to both residential and commercial properties in urban and rural areas. It requires all new tenancy agreements to be in writing and registered with the local Rent Authority, which helps ensure transparency and legal enforceability. The security deposit for residential properties is capped at two months’ rent, and at six months’ rent for non-residential properties, preventing landlords from demanding excessive deposits[3][4].

The Model Tenancy Act establishes a three-tier dispute resolution system: Rent Authorities, Rent Courts, and Rent Tribunals. These bodies are designed to handle tenancy disputes efficiently and relieve the burden on civil courts, which previously led to lengthy delays[1][3].

Tenants have the right to peaceful enjoyment of the property, protection from arbitrary eviction, and privacy. Landlords must give at least twenty-four hours’ notice before entering the premises, except in emergencies. Tenants are responsible for timely rent payments and maintaining the property, while landlords are responsible for major structural repairs unless otherwise agreed[1][4][5].

The Act is prospective, meaning it applies only to new tenancies created after its adoption by a state. Existing tenancies remain governed by previous state laws, which may be less balanced and often favor either landlords or tenants depending on the state[4][5].

One of the key challenges is that the Model Tenancy Act is not binding. States can choose to adopt, modify, or ignore its provisions, leading to a lack of uniformity in rental laws across India. This can limit the effectiveness of the Act in creating a truly national standard for rental housing. Additionally, the Act aims to encourage private investment in the rental market by providing clarity and security for both landlords and tenants, addressing issues that previously led to vacant properties and a lack of formal rental housing supply[2][4][5][6].

In summary, the Model Tenancy Act, 2021 provides a modern framework for rental housing in India, focusing on transparency, fairness, and efficient dispute resolution. However, its impact depends on adoption by individual states, and it does not affect existing rental agreements made before its enactment[4][5][6].
