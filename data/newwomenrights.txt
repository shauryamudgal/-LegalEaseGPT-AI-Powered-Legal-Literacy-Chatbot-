Women's Rights in India – Official Government Data and Legal Framework
Constitutional Guarantees and International Commitments
India ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 9 July 1993, committing to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality.

The Constitution of India guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex (Articles 14, 15, 16).

Affirmative actions are mandated to improve women’s representation in political and public life, although women’s participation remains low (e.g., 14.39% women in Lok Sabha, 8.8% in Rajya Sabha).

Key Legislations Protecting Women’s Rights
Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993: Establishes the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to protect human rights, including women’s rights.

National Commission for Women Act, 1990: Constitutes the National Commission for Women (NCW) for safeguarding and promoting women’s rights.

Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA): Provides protection against physical, mental, emotional, and economic abuse by family members or partners. Defines domestic violence broadly and ensures legal recourse.

Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961: Prohibits giving, taking, or demanding dowry. Harassment related to dowry is punishable, including dowry death provisions.

Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023: Introduced stringent penalties for sexual offenses, including death penalty for rape of girls below 18 years, and expanded the definition of sexual offenses for better protection.

Implementation and Enforcement Mechanisms
The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) collects and publishes data on crimes against women, showing rising reports partly due to better reporting mechanisms.

The government runs Fast Track Special Courts (FTSCs) including exclusive POCSO courts to expedite cases related to sexual offenses and child protection.

Project Stree Manoraksha by NIMHANS and Ministry of Women and Child Development provides trauma-informed mental health care and counselling at One Stop Centres for survivors of gender-based violence.

Despite comprehensive laws, enforcement gaps persist due to lack of monitoring, limited budget, and social challenges.

Social and Political Representation
Women’s workforce participation is 27.4%, with low representation in legislative bodies (14.39% in Lok Sabha, 8.8% in Rajya Sabha).

Recommendations include reserving 33% seats for women in Parliament and State Assemblies to improve political representation.

Statistical Highlights on Gender Equality
According to UN Women data, India has implemented 77.8% of legal frameworks promoting gender equality under SDG indicators, with ongoing gaps in enforcement and monitoring.

Spousal violence among married women (18-49 years) declined marginally from 31.2% (2015-16) to 29.3% (2019-21) as per NFHS-5 report.
